They were not realised? Kahlil Gibran was he not realised? How will you know? Unless and until you are realised you will not know who was realised or not. You will live on these ideas only. You have to feel it. William Blake, was He not realised? He was Markandeya Himself! 
We have forgotten so many things. Even in the Indian Scriptures we never see, we donâ€™t want to see these things.
